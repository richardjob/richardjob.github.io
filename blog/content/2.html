    <p>Just a year made a tremendous growth of the world in technology. 
        Lets look back at the most shocking yet surprising stories of 2019</p>
    <h2>Tesla Armour glass failure</h2>
    <div><img src="./files/2/tesla.jpg" alt="Elon Musk"></div>
    <p>The unveiling of Tesla's Cybertruck was full of surprises.
        <strong>CEO Elon Musk </strong>reffered the glass of the truck as "Transparent Metal".
        But unfortunately, the vehicle's glass was smashed ater being hit with a large stell ball on the live stage.
        It certainly wasn't the result CEO Elon Musk was expecting, who muttered "oh my fucking god" under his breath.
        He completed his presentation in front of the smashed panes of glass. After the event the CEO explained everything in his tweet.

    <h2>The Huawei Ban</h2>
    <div><img src="./files/2/huawei.jpeg" alt="huawei ban"></div>
    <p>Huawei is the world's No.1 telecom supplier and No.2 phone manufacturer.
        The US banned its companies from using Huawei's networking equipments as they are found to spy on other countries.
        Following this, the president limited the business that US companies could do with Huawei by adding it to the entity list.
        This led  Google blocking Huawei from gtting future access to Android. This incident led Huawei users to be confused. 
        However Huawei is still on Google with an extended temporary license.

    <h2>The 1000$ stand</h2>
    <div><img src="./files/2/apple.jpeg" alt="apple stand"></div>
    <p>At Apple's WorldWide Developers Conference (WWDC 2019) Tim Cook announced the new Mac Pro for creative professionals starting at a price of $5,999.
        Along with this, WWDC 2019 had a craziest reveal.
        Apple announced a 6K resolution reference monitor called Pro Display XDR, but the insane fact is that it does not come with an actual stand to hold it.
        The Pro stand for $999, the same price of the last external display Apple sold (came with a stand). 
        This was mocked by people around the world on Twitter.
    </p>
    <h2>Pixel 4 & 4XL not coming to India</h2>
    <div><img src="./files/2/pixel.jpeg" alt="pixel 4"></div>
    <p>Google launced Pixel 4 and Pixel 4Xl on October 15 in the US.
        The 2 phones use soli Radar, a technology that makes use of the 60Ghz frequency.
        The 60Ghz frequency cannot be used in India for civilian purposes ad it is regulated by the government.
        This gives rise to a question, what if you get a Pixel 4 or the Pixel 4Xl outside of India? 
        Aparently the phone will work with reduced functionalities. Google is disabling the Soli Radar functunality on the bais of location.
        Sadely the Soli Radar is the one that powers the most expected Motion Sense feature.
